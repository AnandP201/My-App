# Hello,

My application/project mainly consists of an illustration of how SQL queries work in React and how states are rendered as per our query demand such as insertion, deletion,updation or display of our records/datasets

I have used ReactJS along with React Suite for designing the application. I have also used localstorage in browsers to implement a mock authorization using session id and name. I have also used uuid npm package to generate UUID for session object.

My app's loading time is 3s and I have measured it using LightHouse feature of google chrome. I have minified the used of extensive and unnecessary Javascript libraries
